  All equipment has been recieved. First goal is to organize this page a bit and install Windows Server 2022 Datacenter. I'm sure I can get away with just Standard but a key for Datacenter is currently cheaper.
  Goals slightly organized, I'm not fully sure of what I'm doing yet as I'm new to messing with servers at home. I'm a contractor right now for Apex Systems. I'm trying to learn how to improve and I figure a 
  home lab is the way to go considering that every Lab I've looked at online is sadly more expensive than the equipment you can get these days. I'm going to be reading a few books while I learn how to manage
  the server environment. To start, I do want to understand general management of just the server itself so I figure I may as well start with A+ content.
